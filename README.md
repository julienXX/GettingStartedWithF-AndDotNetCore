# Getting Started With F# And .NET Core

In the process of learning F#, I found that examples targetting F# and .NET Core were quite difficult to find.
I created this repo to document how I did some basic tasks.

## Implemented Tasks

- [x] ParsingJsonFromHttpCall: Making an HTTP call to an API and parsing the JSON response
- [ ] UsingPostgres: Storing and retrieving data from PostgreSQL
- [ ] UsingRabbitMQ: Sending and consuming messages to and from RabbitMQ
- [ ] UsingRedis: Storing and retrieving data from Redis
- [ ] ?

## Running a task

```
λ cd ParsingJsonFromHttpCall
λ dotnet restore
λ dotnet run
```
